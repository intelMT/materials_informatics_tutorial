#Materials Informatics Tutorial
=================================

In this tutorial you will learn about materials informatics - an emerging field  of research at the intersection of materials science and machine learning. You will learn about machine learning, and how machine learning can be exploited for materials discovery. We will focus on a data analytics study of two-dimensional magnetic materials. At the end of this section of the workshop you will be able to predict the chemical stability for 2D materials candidates using machine learning.
